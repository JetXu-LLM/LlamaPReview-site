            <strong>AI Model Usage and Data Processing Transparency:</strong>
            <p>To provide a sustainable and powerful service, we use different AI models depending on your repository's visibility. In all cases, your code is used exclusively to generate the review and is **never used for training AI models.**</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Private (Closed-Source) Repositories:</strong> Your code is processed exclusively by leading AI service providers such as **Mistral AI** or **Google (Gemini API)**. These providers are selected for their stringent security and privacy commitments and are bound by strict data protection agreements.</li>
                <li><strong>For Public (Open-Source) Repositories:</strong> To offer powerful features to the open-source community at a sustainable cost, your code may be processed by the **DeepSeek LLM API**, in addition to the providers mentioned above. As this code is already publicly accessible, this allows for a different cost structure while still maintaining secure processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All AI providers we partner with are contractually obligated not to retain or store your code after processing is complete.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Our data retention policy is designed to minimize data storage:</p>

            <li>Repository code: Not stored. Temporarily held in memory for processing only.</li>
            <li>PR metadata: Retained only while the PR is active.</li>
            <li>Installation data: Retained only while the app remains installed.</li>
